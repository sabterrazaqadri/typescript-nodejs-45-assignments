// Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. 
// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. 
// Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

import { features } from "process";

function storecarinfo (manufacturor : string , modelName : string , ...extraoption: {[key : string]: any } [] ): object {

    const carinfo = {
        manufacturor,
        modelName,
        ...Object.assign({}, ...extraoption)
    }

    return carinfo;

let answer = storecarinfo ('toyota', 'vitz', {colour : 'white'}, {features : ['power mirror', 'cruise control']})
